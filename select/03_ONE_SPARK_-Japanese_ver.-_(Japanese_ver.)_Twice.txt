Ah, he-he-he
One spark, baby
Everybody wants that endless flame
冷めない everlasting blast
願うよ 永遠に そう 永遠に
We're sparkling beautifully (ooh)
美しさ わかってる
君の呼吸 温もりで
燃え続ける energy
If I lose my rhythm then your beat goes on and on (and on and on)
Bring me the, bring me the spark in my veins
Gimme the freedom, the freedom to chase
You know, it's all ours
ずっと make this moment last
'Cause my heart is burning, burning, burning
So good that it's hurting, hurting, hurting
眩しく美しい 痛みでも it's our golden days
Yeah, my heart is burning, burning, burning
Don't lose this spark, baby
並んで見た coral の heaven
火照った頬冷めないで
強く 抱き寄せ
大きく 呼ぶから
君の呼吸 温もりで
燃え続ける energy
If I lose my rhythm then your beat goes on and on (and on and on)
Bring me the, bring me the spark in my veins
Gimme the freedom, the freedom to chase
You know, it's all ours
ずっと make this moment last
Baby
'Cause my heart is burning, burning, burning
So good that it's hurting, hurting, hurting
眩しく美しい 痛みでも it's our golden days
Yeah, my heart is burning, burning, burning
Don't lose this spark, baby
Lighting it up 輝く 時間越えて 光を越えて
Glowing so bright 夢の様な煌めきへ
This is the time of our lives
Carved into our minds
沈まない there ain't no sundown
An everlasting spark to an everlasting fire
Don't let this fire die (oh, burning, ah)
'Cause my heart is burning, burning, burning (oh, my heart is burning, yeah)
So good that it's hurting, hurting, hurting (ooh)
眩しく美しい 痛みでも it's our golden days (yeah)
Yeah, my heart is burning, burning, burning (oh, oh)
Don't lose this spark, baby
My heart is burning, burning, burning
